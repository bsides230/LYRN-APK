# LYRN-AI Cognitive Architecture - v4.2.7

**LYRN (Live-reasoning & Structured Memory)** is a highly modular, professional-grade GUI for interacting with local Language Models. It is designed from the ground up for efficiency, accessibility, and genuine cognitive continuity. It features advanced job automation, live system monitoring, a dynamic prompt building system, and a robust, file-based architecture for memory and inter-process communication.

## Core Philosophy

LYRN is built on a philosophy that diverges significantly from mainstream LLM development. Instead of relying on ever-larger models and prompt injection, LYRN emphasizes **structured, live memory** to achieve genuine continuity, identity, and context. The core tenets are:

-   **Efficiency and Accessibility:** The primary goal is to create a powerful AI cognition framework that is lightweight enough to run on standard consumer hardware.
-   **Structured Memory over Prompt Injection:** All core context—personality, memory, goals—lives in structured text files and memory tables. The LLM reasons from this stable foundation rather than having it repeatedly injected into a limited context window.
-   **Simplicity and Robustness:** The architecture is inspired by the simplicity of 1990s text-based game parsers. The framework's job is to be a robust, simple system for moving data; the LLM's job is to do the heavy lifting of reasoning.

## Major Features

✅ **Modern, Responsive UI**: Built with CustomTkinter for a professional look and feel. Asynchronous initialization ensures the UI loads instantly and never freezes during model operations.

✅ **Live System Monitoring**: Real-time gauges for CPU, RAM, Disk, and VRAM usage.

✅ **Advanced Theming Engine**: Includes a live, in-app Theme Builder to create, modify, and save custom color themes.

✅ **Dynamic System Prompt Builder**: A powerful two-panel UI gives you granular control over every component of the system prompt.
    - Dynamically create, edit, and delete prompt components.
    - Toggle components on or off.
    - Reorder components with arrow keys.
    - Customize block wrappers and content for ultimate flexibility.

✅ **Job & Tool Automation**: A powerful automation system with:
    - A **Job Manager** to create and run complex, multi-step jobs.
    - A **Scheduler** with a full calendar view to run jobs at specific dates and times.
    - A **Cycle Manager** to create and execute custom, multi-step cognitive cycles.
    - Support for the **`gpt-oss` "harmony" format** for defining tools, allowing the AI to be extended with new capabilities.

✅ **Structured, Long-Term Memory**:
    - **Episodic Memory**: Saves each chat interaction as a structured, searchable file.
    - **Topic Indexing**: A background process that identifies and indexes topics from conversations to build a personalized web of meaning over time.
    - **Quote System**: Right-click any text in the chat to "Quote to Context" for easy reference.

✅ **Chat Persistence & Control**:
    - Chat history is automatically saved and reloaded between sessions.
    - Fine-grained control over how much chat history and which memory "deltas" are injected into the context for each turn.

✅ **Full Model Control**:
    - Save and load model configuration presets for one-click setup.
    - In-app controls for all key generation parameters (`temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, etc.).
    - Stop generation at any time with a dedicated button.

## Quick Start

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r dependencies/requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Place Models**:
    -   Create a folder named `models` in the root directory.
    -   Place your GGUF-format model files inside the `models/` folder.

3.  **Run Application**:
    ```bash
    python lyrn_sad_v4.2.6.pyw
    ```

4.  **First Launch Setup**:
    -   On the first launch, the "Model Settings" window will appear.
    -   Select your model from the dropdown, adjust parameters if needed, and click "Load Model".
    -   The application auto-generates `settings.json` to store all configurations.

## Key Files

### Core Application
- `lyrn_sad_v4.2.6.pyw` - The main GUI application file.
- `settings.json` - Auto-generated configuration file for model settings, paths, and UI preferences.
- `automation/` - Contains all background watcher scripts and configurations for autonomous operation.
- `build_prompt/` - Contains all modular components for building the system prompt.
- `themes/` - Directory containing JSON theme files.
- `dependencies/requirements.txt` - A list of all required Python packages.

### Documentation
- `README.md` - This guide.
- `build_notes.md` - A detailed, version-by-version change log of all updates.
- `AGENTS.md` - Instructions and architectural rules for AI agent development on this codebase.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Application doesn't start**: Ensure all dependencies from `dependencies/requirements.txt` are installed.
- **Model won't load**: Check the console output. Ensure the model path is correct in the "Model Settings" popup and the file is not corrupt.
- **Missing folders**: Most required folders (like `models/`) are created automatically on startup. If you encounter issues, deleting `settings.json` will trigger the first-time setup again.
- **Automation not working**: Ensure the relevant watcher scripts are running. You can check your system's task manager for multiple python processes.
